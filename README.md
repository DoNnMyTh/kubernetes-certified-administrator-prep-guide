# Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) Exam Curriculum 1.12.0

The objective of this repository is help you for taking the Kubernetes Certified Administrator Certification exam using online resources, especially using resources from the [Kubernetes Oficial Documentation](https://kubernetes.io).

The references were selected for the Exam Curriculum 1.12.0, which uses the Kubernetes 1.12 version, and there are exclusive information for API objects and annotations. For more information, please see [CKA Curriculum 1.12.0](https://github.com/cncf/curriculum/blob/master/CKA_Curriculum_V1.12.0.pdf).

Please, feel free to place a pull request whether something is not up-to-date, should be added or contains wrong information/reference.

## Exam

The exam is kind of "put your hands on", were you have 24 problems to fix within 180 minutes. Based on that, you have ~7.5 minutes per problem, where usually you will spend more time in some questions than others.

My tip: Spend your time wisely. Use the Notebook feature (provided in exam's UI) to keep track of your progress, where you might take notes of each question, put some anottations in order to help you. Additionally, don't get stuck, move to the next problem, and take it back when you finish all the other problems.

Exam Cost: $300 and includes one free retake. 

For information about the exam, please refer [Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) Program](https://www.cncf.io/certification/cka/).
